I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland College Park, advised by Prof. [Zaoxing Liu](https://zaoxing.github.io/). Before joining UMD, I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Boston University.

My research journey has included building applications around large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems in network research. I have also developed using transformers for the recognition and detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) within intricate system environments. Currently, my work focuses on creating generative data systems designed to support biomedicine fields.
